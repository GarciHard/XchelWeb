                <p class="chef-bio--container__text">
                    Martha has a sensitive vision of life, from which she invents new universes. Researcher and
                    connoisseur of social reality (a subject that she studied professionally), she has a deep love for
                    our country and its culture. In her daily work, she has managed to combine both aspects, that of
                    creation, imagination, the discovery of beautiful novelties, on the one hand, and that of flavors
                    and customs inscribed in Mexican roots. Thus, she has to her credit several cookbooks, as well as an
                    important participation in international festivals and congresses.<br><br>
                    The trajectory of Martha Ortiz Chapa shines with its own light in an essential field of that past
                    and always present history of the country, which is her gastronomy. But in her case it is not a
                    conventional work or kitchen. She inhabits the world of Mexican cuisine to enjoy all the imaginable
                    pleasures that it entails, and not only in the inexhaustible terrain of the senses but also in that
                    of its development and its meaning.<br><br>
                    The cook loves talking stories with her recipes and she loves visiting markets, as well as admiring
                    the most important haute couture collections in the world. She walks through museums and enjoys
                    reading, late at night, to keep in mind the pictorial in the kitchen and the flavors in the word,
                    which is reflected in the titles of her dishes-stories, the great staging . In this way, she is both
                    an expert in gastronomic art and an informed and imaginative interpreter of our flavors and
                    traditions. Evidence of such richness is the premises of the Dulce Patria restaurant —lit with
                    flavor, seasoning and aroma— that Martha Ortiz Chapa runs successfully in Mexico City and which was
                    recently included in the list of Acqua Panna and St. Pellegrino “Latin America's 50 Best Restaurants
                    2015 ″, as well as various awards and recognitions among which is the mention of Forbes Mexico, last
                    February, as one of the 30 promises of businesses in our country.
