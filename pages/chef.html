                <p>
                    Martha has a sensitive vision of life, from which she invents new universes. Researcher and
                    connoisseur of social reality (a subject that she studied professionally), she has a deep love for our country and its
                    culture. In her daily work, she has managed to combine both aspects, that of creation, imagination, the discovery of
                    beautiful novelties, on the one hand, and that of flavors and customs inscribed in Mexican roots. Thus, she
                    has to her credit several cookbooks, as well as an important participation in international festivals and congresses.
                    The trajectory of Martha Ortiz Chapa shines with its own light in an essential field of that past
                    and always present history of the country, which is her gastronomy. But in her case it is not a conventional work or
                    kitchen. She inhabits the world of Mexican cuisine to enjoy all the imaginable pleasures that it entails, and not
                    only in the inexhaustible terrain of the senses but also in that of its development and its meaning.
                    The cook loves talking stories with her recipes and she loves visiting markets, as well as admiring
                    the most important haute couture collections in the world. She walks through museums and enjoys reading, late
                    at night, to keep in mind the pictorial in the kitchen and the flavors in the word, which is reflected in the
                    titles of her dishes-stories, the great staging . In this way, she is both an expert in gastronomic art and an
                    informed and imaginative interpreter of our flavors and traditions. Evidence of such richness is the premises of
                    the Dulce Patria restaurant —lit with flavor, seasoning and aroma— that Martha Ortiz Chapa runs successfully in
                    Mexico City and which was recently included in the list of Acqua Panna and St. Pellegrino “Latin America's 50 Best
                    Restaurants 2015 ″, as well as various awards and recognitions among which is the mention of Forbes Mexico, last February,
                    as one of the 30 promises of businesses in our country.
